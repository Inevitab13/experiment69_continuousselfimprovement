Current ideas but subject to change. Oh and don't try anything I do, seriously. 

I mean it, not fucking kidding boys. Not a good idea. 

.... but if you do, please do send videos! And also to my long suffering employer, please be advised that nothing I say or do reflects in any way on the values, my actual actual job (nothing from work goes in I promise) and the prinicples of the organization I work for. So don't go hassling folks from my work,  you got a problem you talk to me direct mate. Not kidding, but I also encourage my fellow colleagues to send in your memes because I'll get those in somehow too. #nodickheads
